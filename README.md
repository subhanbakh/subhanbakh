## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Subhan Bakh, a multidisciplinary designer and developer crafting impactful brand identities, intuitive UI/UX design, and functional websites for clients and agencies worldwide. 

Some of the tech I love working with:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- React, Nextjs
- Threejs, Framer Motion, GSAP, React Three Fiber
- Tailwind CSS

I began my career as a graphic designer, but my path quickly evolved as I fell in love with digital design and development. Since then, I've dabbled in all kinds of creative disciplines â€” from crafting user interfaces and building brand identities to coding websites and creating 3D designs.
