## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Subhan Bakh, a freelance design engineer based in Azerbaijan.

Some of the tech I love working with:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- React, Nextjs
- Threejs, Framer Motion, Gsap, React Three Fiber
- Tailwind CSS

I began my career as a graphic designer, and since then I've dabbled in all sorts of cool stuff - from UI/UX, branding, front-end dev to 3D, motion design, and everything in between"
