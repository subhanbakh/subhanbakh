## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Subhan Bakh, a freelance design engineer based in Azerbaijan.

Some of the tech I love working with:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- React, Nextjs
- Threejs, Framer Motion, Gsap, React Three Fiber
- Tailwind CSS

I began my career as a graphic designer, but my career path quickly evolved as I fell in love with digital design and development. Since then, I've dabbled in all sorts of creative disciplines â€” from crafting user interfaces and building brand identities to coding websites, creating 3D designs, and bringing designs to life with motion.
This journey has let me play in every corner of the digital playground, constantly pushing myself to learn new skills and sharpen my craft.
