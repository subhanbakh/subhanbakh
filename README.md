## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Subhan Bakh, a freelance design engineer from Azerbaijan, currently based in Montenegro.

Some of the tech I love working with:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- React, Nextjs
- Threejs, Framer Motion, Gsap, React Three Fiber
- Tailwind CSS

I began my career as a graphic designer, but my path quickly evolved as I fell in love with digital design and development. Since then, I've dabbled in all sorts of creative disciplines â€” from crafting user interfaces and building brand identities to coding websites and creating 3D designs.
